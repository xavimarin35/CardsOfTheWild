# CardsOfTheWild

Hi all,

we have uploaded a complete version of Cards of the Wild (assignment 3). You can use it as base for your submission, as we are aware that there is not enough time for you to develop a complete version of the game.

Given that the game is already working, your tasks will be to explore/improve/extend one or more aspects of the game, and document that on a report.

You can focus on any aspect of the game:

-The neural network

-The encoding of states and actions

-The Q-learning algorithm

-Change the game rules

-Analize the learning process (of the neural network or of the reinforcement learning)

-Improve the learning process (of the neural network or of the reinforcement learning)
-Improve the visual appearance

As you will see, the Q-learning agent does not know the rules at all, so at the beginning most of its actions are illegal. This slows down the learning process; there is room for improvement here too.

Please do not hesitate to propose us your ideas on what to do on the assignment if you are not sure that your contributions will be enough/too much.

Have a nice weekend.
